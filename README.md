## Description:
This project is a clone implmentation of the bash shell. It is capable of all of the operations of the original bash. 


## Build Instructions:
After downloading the files in this repository to your personal computer, the project can be built by compiling all of the source code files in one simple step by using the included Makefile. In order to build the project properly, all of the files (including the Makefile) must be within the same directory.
The git commands are included for my academic github, but can be omitted for other users. 


## Run Instructions: 
Once the project is built, the user can utilize MyShell as a bash clone by typing 'shell' in the terminal. Any operation that can be performed on the original bash can be performed with MyShell, including IO redirection, subshells, and more. There is also support for shell scripts that include while loops, for loops, 
if-statements, environment variables, etc.
